TalentBridger

TalentBridger is an online platform to bridge the communication gap between students from non-target schools and recruiters at companies by allowing students to showcase their intangible skills and talents to companies by completing a series of games and puzzles. Our mission is to help these students obtain the opportunities that they deserve while also helping companies discover talented individuals that they otherwise would have overlooked.
